Description: Joint distribution of number of crossings and the 
  longest run in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. The
  computations uses an iterative procedure where computations 
  are based on results from shorter series. The procedure 
  conditions on the start value and partitions by further 
  conditioning on the position of the first crossing (or none).
  Also included are these joint distributions in a sequence of
  independent continuous observations classified as above or below
  the empirical median.
